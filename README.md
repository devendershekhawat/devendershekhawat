Hello! üëãüèΩ

I'm Devender Shekhawat, but you can call me Dev.

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com). With over 6 years of experience in the industry, My primary focus has been on building robust and scalable frontends. I have a particular passion for developing rich content editors.

I like writing technical blogs for teaching Javascript to beginners. Check it out [here](https://devcodesthings.hashnode.dev/).

These are the latest articles I have written.
